# PulseVox üó£‚ú®

PulseVox is a smart, command-line voice assistant designed to turn your spoken words into organized, actionable plans.  
This project serves as a powerful proof-of-concept for a frictionless personal planning tool.  
By leveraging modern Speech-to-Text and Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, PulseVox can understand complex, multi-part commands and intelligently extract tasks, appointments, and reminders, saving them directly to a local file.

## üöÄ Core Features (MVP)
- **Voice-to-Text Transcription:** Listens to your voice commands and accurately converts them into text.  
- **Intelligent Task Parsing:** Uses a state-of-the-art LLM (like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT) to understand natural language and extract key details from complex sentences.  
- **Multi-Task Recognition:** Say multiple tasks in one go (e.g., ‚ÄúRemind me to call Mom at 5 PM and also buy groceries tomorrow‚Äù). PulseVox will identify and separate them.  
- **Entity Extraction:** Automatically identifies categories (To-do, Call, Appointment), dates, and times from your commands.  
- **Audio Feedback:** Provides verbal confirmation once tasks have been successfully processed and saved.  
- **Persistent Storage:** Saves all extracted tasks in a clean, human-readable `tasks.json` file.
